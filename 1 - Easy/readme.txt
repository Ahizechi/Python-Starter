# Easy Python Projects

This collection of Python scripts represents 'easy' level coding projects. These projects are ideal for beginners and those new to Python or programming in general. Here's what defines an 'easy' project:

- **Basic Concepts**: Involves fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, basic data structures (like lists and dictionaries), and functions.

- **Minimal Libraries**: Primarily uses Python's standard library with little to no reliance on external libraries.

- **Short and Simple**: Projects are relatively short, straightforward, and focus on a single, simple task or problem.

- **Learning Outcomes**: Great for grasping the basics of Python syntax and control structures, and understanding how to manipulate data types.
